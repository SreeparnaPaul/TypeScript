# TypeScript

- Typescript is a superset of javascript
- Typescript is all about Type safety
- Typescript does the static checking.If we are trying to access a object which is not defined , typescript will show us the error, this is called static checking.
- We write typescript code and that is compiled or transpiled into javascript.
